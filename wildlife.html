                harbours an incredible selection of
                flora and fauna and is home to some of the finest national parks of the subcontinent. Home to a variety
                of species including the elusive leopard, regal elephant, blue whale and exotic birds, below is a list
                of the best places to see diverse and exciting wildlife on a tailor made holiday to Sri Lanka.</p>

                <img src="./images/Leopard-Sri-Lanka.jpg" alt="leopard">
                <p>Located on Sri Lanka’s south east coast and established as a protected area in 1938, Yala National
                    Park
                    is a large reserve with a mixture of habitats ranging from open parkland and dense jungle, to a
                    myriad
                    of flooded lagoons and high coastal sand dunes. This varied terrain supports a wide range of flora
                    and
                    fauna. <br><br><br>
                    The popular Yala National Park is believed to have the world’s highest concentration of leopards.
                    The
                    average density of these majestic creatures is as high as one cat to every square kilometre,
                    although
                    sightings of the elusive leopard are still rare. Other animals you might spot whilst in Yala include
                    both sambar and spotted deer, wild boar, crocodile, langur and toque monkey, golden jackal and even
                    the
                    sloth bear during June and July when the palu tree fruits. Birdlife is also abundant here with over
                    200
                    species recorded and the reserve is a perfect combination of freshwater, marine, scrub and woodland
                    areas for the diversity of birds.</p>

                    A UNESCO-listed World Heritage Site and Biosphere Reserve, Sinharaja Forest Reserve is the last
                    viable area of primary tropical rainforest in Sri Lanka featuring tumbling waterfalls, bubbling
                    pools and emerald ferns. Situated in the south west of the island, the forest’s canopy towers up to
                    45m and astonishingly over two-thirds of the trees are endemic, many of them even considered rare.
                    <br><br><br>
                    However, one of the main reasons to visit Sinharaja is for the excellent birdwatching. The reserve
                    supports over 80% of the island’s bird species as well as being a habitat for endemic birds such as
                    the green-billed coucal, the blue magpie and the red-faced malkoha. Butterflies, insects, amphibians
                    and reptiles also live in this rich biodiverse reserve as well as mammals such as the rare leopard,
                    purple-faced langur, rusty spotted cat and three types of squirrel.

                    alt="leopard">
                <p>Up in the central highlands, the Horton Plains measure up to an impressive 2,100 metres above sea
                    level, making it the highest plateau in Sri Lanka and consequently named of the ‘Roof of the
                    Island’. The plains comprise largely of cloud forest and lush montane grasslands which are rich in
                    endemic plants and animals that have adapted to the cool climate. <br><br><br>
                    Whilst the elephant disappeared from this region back in the 1940s, the Horton Plains are home to a
                    wide variety of mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles. The most common mammal seen is the sambar
                    deer who skirts through the long grasses and moves in large herds. Giant squirrels, wild boars,
                    rusty-spotted cats and purple-faced langurs are amongst some of the 24 species of mammal found here,
                    and the Horton Plains slender loris, one of the world’s most endangered primates, can also be found
                    in the highlands. Rare lizard species such as the rhino-horned lizard reside in the cloud forests,
                    and for bird enthusiasts there are both a huge range of migratory and endemic birds to watch.</p>

                <p>Declared a Nature Reserve in 1988 and then upgraded to national park status in 2002, the Hikkaduwa
                    National Park in the southern province is one of only two marine national parks in Sri Lanka.
                    Although the southern coastline is home to many coral reefs, the reefs in Hikkaduwa are the most
                    diverse and accessible and offer some of the country’s best snorkelling and diving opportunities.
                    <br><br><br>
                    The main reef of Hikkaduwa sits in a sheltered lagoon, it is a typical fringing reef with an average
                    depth of about 5 metres. The coral is colourful and diverse with around 60 different species
                    including boulder and encrusting corals, small-strands of Acropora coral and the cabbage-like
                    Montipora coral. The seagrass is home to sea turtles, whilst tropical reef fish such as parrot fish,
                    angel fish and butterfly fish skirt through the corals. Along the outer slope of the reef, blacktip
                    reef sharks can be found along with hawksbill and green turtles.

                        the dry zone. A majority of records from the dry zone come from Wasgomuwa, Yala, Udawalawa,

                        berries. They move about in the canopy in small groups and form alliances with other species of
                        birds when feeding (mixed species feeding flocks).</div>

                        distances while foraging for the large quantities of food that they require to sustain their
                        massive bodies.</div>
